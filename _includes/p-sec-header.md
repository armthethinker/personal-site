               <p>Exictos, a bank software leader in the Lusophone (Portuguese-speaking) market, approached our team, Elementary, to <strong>create a contextually-aware consumer banking experience</strong>. Preferably, something that can be highly adaptable to the various users that use Exictos products.</p>
               <p>After four months of user and market research, we found that consumer banking applications are opaque, meaning that users donâ€™t really know what is happening. <strong>When people look at their finances, they are asking three questions</strong>:</p>
               <ol>
                  <li>How am I doing?</li>
                  <li>How will I be doing?</li>
                  <li>If I do this (get a new job, move to a new city, travel), what will happen?</li>
               </ol>
               <p>Instead of helping their users, banks (often) only provide a list of transactions from which users are supposed to intuit their financial health.</p>

   content="There is an increasing sense of apathy in classrooms and seeming lack of passion around the world.

- People talk about answers without exploring foundational questions.
- Humans are not generally trained in problem solving techniques.
- “Interdisciplinary” seems to be used in talk more often than practice.
- Humans have a hard time exploring vastly different viewpoints from their own."

   **We helped 1,000s of people solve problems by teaching them how to ask better, more radical questions.** Our solution was to create a company that focused on **active curiosity** (being curious and doing something about it).

   **Our primary product was an annual conference + workshop and a book for 8-12 year olds.** We also created a platform for independent conferences, facilitated workshops, and almost made a makerspace. We brought together different groups of people to have conversations starting with questions. "

   I cofounded What If…? with Matt Murrie, splitting the company 50–50. Each of us were cofounders and Chief Curiosity Curators (a brand appropriate name for co-CEO). As our roles developed, Matt focused on external dealings: partnerships, contacts, and networking."

   content="Matt and I are from liberal arts backgrounds.

   What If…? began with a conversation between Matt Murrie and myself. We talked about apathy in the classroom and a lack of curiosity in the world. I was then a college student and he an English professor, both of us at Westminster College. In a year from our initial conversation, we had cofounded a company.

From that conversation grew the idea of _What If…?_: an interdisciplinary gathering, where speakers take eight minutes to explore a question. The presenters and audiences (off-stage presenters) would be filled with students, professors, entrepreneurs, CEOs, retirees, auto mechanics, engineers, artists, poets, and community members — all asking questions, exploring possibilities, and getting the motivation to go out and create something new. We co-authored the future.

The core of _What If…?_ is like water. Each project we take on is like a new container to mold that core. The water is always the same, but the shape changes to fit the needs of the project. Each project had the following qualities."

   content="**Democratizing question-asking** In teacher-student environments, students are often shy of asking questions. “It isn’t their place. The teacher is the expert. What could students meaningfully ask?” At our events or in our book, we flatten this hierarchy to allow anyone to ask a question. By recognizing and respecting the abilities of both experts and novices, the two can have a more balanced and engaging conversation."

We encouraged participants to question it all — as long as they were diligent in their question asking methodology. No one is interested in vapid questions, but our audiences love insightful explorations of intriguing questions."

Over three years, we put over 1,000 people through our confence experiences. Each conference had a series of eight minute talks, diverse conversation groups, a deeper workshop, and an environment that encourages active curiosity. We helped people solve problems by asking better, more foundational questions.

We constantly refined our process from audience feedback and our own observations. For example, we found that our initial lack of structure for the breakout discussions led to highly variable conversation-quality. We created a structured breakout model, tested it at a few small events, then used it in our annual conference.

We have been honored to be sponsored by Quirky; littleBits; Schlafly Beer; the Reagional Economic Development Inc. for Columbia, MO; the SociaLIGHT Conference; Callaway Bank; Columbia Business Times; and others."

My first book, _The Book of What If…?: Questions and Activities for Curious Minds_, came out in 2016 (co-written with Matt Murrie, published by Aladdin / Beyond Words, an imprint of Simon & Schuster).

<a class='btn btn-outline' href='http://amzn.com/1582705291' target='_blank'>Amazon: _The Book of What If…?: Questions and Activities for Curious Minds_ ></a>

The book is comprised of question-based entries, starting with “What If…?”. Each entry explores a What If…? question and helps our reader (8–12 year olds) understand a few foundational facts. Most entries also have an activity for kids to delve deeper into the question. Some entires have peer-interviews with other kids; expert interviews with the likes of David Eagleman, Amber Case, and Aubrey de Grey; and profiles on historic individuals.

**Facilitated workshops** On occasion, Matt and I facilitated workshops for groups of kids. These were smaller, customized versions of our conference flow. Each workshop pushed participants through a question-asking process and they always culminated in some form of sharing, usually a short stand up.

**Independent conferences** We helped communities facilitate their own conferences, allowing others to ask their own questions and to let us try out new ideas before our big conference. We worked with independent organizers to understand our materials and processes. During my time, I helped others facilitate their own conferences in St. Louis, Philadelphia, and a few at high-schools in Columbia, MO.

   content="**Makerspace** Keith Politte provoked Matt and I into exploring the idea of a makerspace: a place for makers, creatives, hackers, and hobbyists. If the conference is for non-tangible ideas, a makerspace helps communities explore physical questions. My research showed most makerspace members were middle-age, white guys — not the diverse crowd What If…? attracts. Our team, later including cofounder Lisa Bunch, explored properties and prepared financial models for a business loan. Our work culminated at a Startup Weekend where we finalized our business model and began work on an Indiegogo campaign. At the event, we collaborated with Olivia Keth, Lauren Rundquist, and Nelson Muller. Ultimately, the project failed shortly after the Startup Weekend when one of our founders left the project. The conference was our first priority, and as such, we couldn’t continue to sustain the MakerSpace work."

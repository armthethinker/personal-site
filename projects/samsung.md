I can't talk about what I do exactly, but I can give a bit of insight into how I work on any spatial design problem. Some of my work is pure design research, some is for future products, and the rest is for somewhere in between.

- Even though everything looks different, high level design principles are the same (e.g. Neilson's usability heuristics, Case's principles of calm technology, Rams' principles for good design, Maeda laws of simplicity)
- Questions you need to ask yourself when designing spatially
- The various constraints you're faced with
- Example critiques, similar to feedback I'd give to my teammates
- Tools to use and guidance to use the tool that will best help you think through the problem at hand
- What it takes to get hired in this industry
- My particular path

   I think beyond our current black rectangles. I create novel interactions and product strategies. I figure out how to meet or overcome our constraints. I design for moving targets and design for various device capabilities simultaneously.

Sometimes AR examples are limited to things we can already do well on flat devices. My work tries to go beyond these simple examples – into experiences we can only have with spatial computers.

When I'm thinking through interaction problems on my team, there exists a wide swath of presentation options.

### My team
**My team is the XR Design Group (XRDG).** We work under MPS Lab under Samsung Research America (SRA). Together, we find meaningful ways to build future facing technologies.

**Our core team consists of around eight designers and engineers** (though we collaborate with teams across Samsung). We all participate in the entire design and development process, but focus on own specialties. Our tight collaboration leads us to better solutions.

**I am the most senior product designer**, though not the most senior designer (that honor would go to one of the two artist-engineers on our team from the games industry).

### My role

**Priorities & vision**: Through my years of work before and at Samsung, I've developed specific principles for what AR and VR can and should be. These guide my decisions and help to set the team's vision.

I work with my manager to set priorities for the team, arguing for directions that would have the highest returns on investment.

**Design & process**: I'm still an individual contributor, so I work on ideation, mockups, prototypes, and user research.

I guide the team to produce high quality work from the design side. This means contributions to what we should continue to explore, what's ready to prototype, which tradeoffs should be made so we can meet our deadlines, and working with engineering to figure out implementation details.

**Documentation**: I lead our documentation efforts (writing, editing, crafting the story, presenting). This also makes me a go to person for any of our historical work. Before our switch to a more collaborative tool, I created a custom website to showcase our documentation, design decisions, and ideations.

**Presenting & collaborating**: I talk about our work to other teams and external partners. I also present to a number of lab heads, VPs, SVPs, Presidents, and once I presented to a group of Korean Congresspeople.

**Patents**: I've produced three spatial design patents that are working their way through the USPTO.

**Mentoring**: I'm there for my teammates when they a hand thinking about a spatial design problem or how to navigate Samsung.

   header="What I find most valuable about this work"
   subheader=""
   content="
**It's a new medium and I have a moral duty to help make it a good one.** There are few opportunities – if any – in your career to help shape the direction of a new medium. Each new medium presents new opportunities and challenges to humanity. I do what I can to create more opportunities in spatial computing than challenges.

**Everything is challenging and ambiguous.** While the high-level design principles are the same in spatial computing, there aren't clear answers for any particular problem. Each decision requires investigation. And, I've had to learn new tools to ideate and build spatial products.

- **Unity** for on-device prototypes
- **Blender** for volumetric interaction ideation and renders, modeling, animation
- **Tilt Brush, Blocks, Tvori, Quill, Maquette** for volumetric interactions and renders, modeling, animation, and non-interactive off-device prototypes
- **Sketch** for flat mockups, visual explorations, flows
- **Framer** for interaction ideas that I can explore more quickly in Framer (for less volumetric ideas)
- **Pen & paper** for quick divergent ideation

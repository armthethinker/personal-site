When I was in my dual-degree master‚Äôs program at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and Madeira Interactive Technologies Institute (M-ITI), we spent a semester at CMU, then two semesters in Portugal, separated by a one semester internship.

**I didn't find an internship that would let me explore what I needed to, so I decided to create my own. I spent a few months researching core VR UX challenges in shorter, focused design sprints.**

**The big question: \"What are the best practices for UX design in VR and how should we prototype our designs?\".** I went about answering it with one to two week long sprint starting with a question, followed by a design exploration, prototyping, and user testing. I needed to also allocate time and resources efficiently, to ensure I got what I needed out of my internship.

In my process, I had four goals:

1. **Learn more software to help me express my ideas.** <br>This was primarily A-Frame (JavaScript) and a touch of Unity.
1. **Focus on creating humane designs.** <br>I mean, this is really my role as a UX designer anyway, but it‚Äôs important to emphasize. As we move into humanity's next dominant medium (spatial interfaces), we should do everything we can to make it a good one. (Inspired by Bret Victor.)
1. **Design through rapid, interactive prototypes.** <br>While apps and websites can easily be expressed on paper, spatial interfaces require prototypes that match its dimensionality. Additionally, I needed to get better at producing many prototypes to explore an idea. (Inspired by Linda Dong.)
1. **Regularly share and interact with my greater communities.** <br>Experimentation done in a vacuum is largely worthless. My own work has been informed from other early explorers. Because of my public efforts, others can start their work more easily. And, sharing regularly gives me a chance to refine my documentation skills.

I ended up publishing weekly journals and a few case studies under my <a href='https://medium.com/humane-virtuality' target='_blank'>Humane Virtuality Medium publication</a>.

   - üë®üèª‚Äçüé® **UX Designer**: think, sketch, and define each experience/experiment.

   - ü§î **User Researcher**: getting feedback is incredibly important, but given the experimental nature and ‚Äúearliness‚Äù of many of the prototypes, a few user interviews is all I need.
   - ‚úçÔ∏è **Writer**: accurately convey my work and insights to the greater design and development community.

I build an environment with togglable elements and various interaction methods:

1. Rotate target with head rotation _and_ scale the input (letting a user move a small amount to see behind the target)
1. Rotate target _inversely_ with head rotation and scale the input
1. For each abover method, toggle the target to be locked to the world or to a relative position from the user's head

After hearing a podcast on SpaceVR, I was inspired to create an experience based on their project. Their goal is to send a satellite into space which would capture spherical video people on the Earth could experience in VR.

I started by building a model solar system where I had a lot of control over where I could place the camera, yielding a set of viewpoints. However, I realized I was building something more complicated than I set out to do. So, I wrapped it up and re-started. For my second attempt, I had a clearer project in-mind: less robust, more to the point.

   header="Overall learnings"
   content="Each experiment looked at a very particular VR UX problem. After working with enough specifics, I can generalize my design insights and prototyping expertise.

**Design**
- The world wraps around the user. Utilize all of it.
- Text with too much depth hurts legibility.
- Sketch in 20 directions before choosing one to build.
- Volumetric design tools geared towards UX work are highly limited, but opening quickly. Figure out your own best-practices.
- Small cursors on screens with low-pixel density tend to jump around.
- A few techniques used in different industries are starting to come together: cinematography, theater (especially stage design), and traditional UX.
- You have a community. Use it and let them use you.

**Prototyping**
- Like other prototypes, have a good idea of what you‚Äôre building before you build. Go ahead and shift direction as you learn though.
- 3D models, especially ones from hand-written code, take time to make.
- Not all prototypes need 3D models.
- It‚Äôs √ºber useful to have working knowledge of spherical and cylindrical coordinate systems.
- It‚Äôs useful to build a personal library of helper functions.

**User studies**
- User testing interaction experiments is more open-ended than testing robust apps. Think-alouds work well.
- Users get distracted. Let them know they were heard, then push them in the direction you are interested in.
- Given the state of consumer-awareness and experience, it‚Äôs likely you‚Äôre the first person to give your test users access to VR. Let them be amazed.
- Focus on what you‚Äôre testing. If the visual design isn‚Äôt important, use someone else‚Äôs work there.
- A few settings variables and keyboard shortcuts exponentially speed up personal testing during development.

Exictos, a bank software leader in the Lusophone (Portuguese-speaking) market, approached our team, Elementary, to **create a contextually-aware consumer banking experience**. Preferably, something that can be highly adaptable to the various users that use Exictos products.

After four months of user and market research, we found that consumer banking applications are opaque, meaning that users don’t really know what is happening. **When people look at their finances, they are asking three questions**:

1. How am I doing?
1. How will I be doing?
1. If I do this (get a new job, move to a new city, travel), what will happen?

Instead of helping their users, banks (often) only provide a list of transactions from which users are supposed to intuit their financial health.

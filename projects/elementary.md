   content="
Exictos, a bank software leader in the Lusophone (Portuguese-speaking) market, approached our team, Elementary, to **create a contextually-aware consumer banking experience**. Preferably, something that can be highly adaptable to the various users that use Exictos products.

After four months of user and market research, we found that consumer banking applications are opaque, meaning that users don’t really know what is happening. **When people look at their finances, they are asking three questions**:

1. How am I doing?
1. How will I be doing?
1. If I do this (get a new job, move to a new city, travel), what will happen?

Instead of helping their users, banks (often) only provide a list of transactions from which users are supposed to intuit their financial health.

   **Exictos (our client)**, formerly known as Promosoft, was founded in 1989. They specialize in the production and implementation of core banking software, serving more than 60 banks in Portuguese-speaking countries. Exictos expanded their offerings to include both mobile and online banking software as a layer over their core platform. In 2015, Exictos was acquired by the Polish Asseco group to strengthen its presence in Africa and to open up new opportunities for expansion in South American markets, especially Brazil."

   content="Our research spanned our first four months of work. To guide our investigation into Portuguese consumer banking, we created a series of core questions. Each question lead us to a research method.

- What is already known about the banking market?<br>
_Literature Review, Market Study_
- What do users already use and have?<br>
_Survey, User Study_
- What are our competitors doing?<br>
_Competitive Analysis, Market Study_
- How do users think about money?<br>
_Interviews, User Study_
- How do our users live?<br>
_Photo Diary Study, User Study_

To interpret our data, we created models including a flow model, sequence diagrams, a cultural model, and a competitive analysis grid. We also printed out the photos and captions users created in their photo diaries. Everything went up on our walls so we could be immersed in our research during the later design phase."

{% include p-section.html
   header="Research insights"
   subheader=""
   content="Concluding our research phase, we compiled a short list of critical insights made from our research data. These are the most relevant insights.

### Lack of trust in banks and online merchants
Users strongly distrust banks and their intentions, often taking steps to obfuscate their purchasing habits.

### High degree of personal control
Users make conscious decisions for how they will pay for things, taking control of their money use. users often have to or choose to go through multiple steps in order to achieve their goals.

### Banks fail their customers
Banks are not providing services in a way that pleases their users. When customers have problems, they are unlikely to contact the bank about it. Instead, users get frustrated and begin looking for new banks. This is especially true when banks charge “maintenance fees”. Without adequate communication, users wonder what these fees are for and suspect that the banks just want to take their money.

### Difficulty tracking expenses and budgeting
When users want to know where their money is going, they track it. But, the tools provided to them by banks are insufficient. our data shows that most users do some form of expense tracking or budgeting. Excel and mental-tracking are the most popular forms of estimating budgets.

### Unused savings options
Often aware of savings options, few users have savings accounts or other investments. In interviews they remark that they “should have an account, but don’t”."

We explored each part of our five part vision in four week-long design sprints (our fifth part was explored throughout). With the user feedback, we were able to condense what made sense, get rid of what didn’t, and update what needed improvements.

In the time after our sprints, we continuously critiqued our work, iterated on it, and tested with users weekly. At the end, we presented two hi-fi prototypes: one showcasing visual design and another for interaction design."

### Principles

   **Transparency** Users have questions about their transactions, groups of transactions, and patterns. We made it easy to answer these questions.

   **Foresight** We give users just enough insight into their future so they can be prepared. These insights are based on the user’s previous actions.

   **Relation of user to others** When you’re doing something for the first time, you don’t know what to expect. We allow users to anonymously learn from each other by showing them how “other users like you” have acted.

### Sprint process
   As the project manager, I implemented the Sprint process as outlined by Jake Knapp, John Zeratsky, and Braden Kowitz. We worked through four week-long sprints which each include complementary research, sketches, a prototype, and user testing. It is a process that uses divergent and convergent thinking, harnessing the strengths of each member of the team. In this phase, each prototype is independent from the others.

   Goals act as savings buckets, meaning that users can save towards different objectives such as a new vehicle, a trip, or paying off a loan. Goals are flexible and can be paused, money can be transferred in and out, and goals can be continuous. Perhaps most importantly **goals create achievable outcomes based on existing mental models**.

   Money virtually and automatically transfers between the user’s main account and goal account to keep a distinction between allocated and unallocated funds. Their money is automatically balanced between a current/checking account and a high interest savings account based on the user’s habits.

  subtitle: An exploration of the trolley problem
  description: Moral questions are often posed in writing or conversation. We created a virtual environment to test an isomorph of the Trolley Problem. Using VR, we were able to situate participants in a realistic scenario whereas traditional thought experiments are tested through text or conversation. We found that participants who have haptic feedback are less likely to kill one personâ€Šâ€”â€Šin order to save fourâ€Šâ€”â€Šthan their non-haptic counterparts.

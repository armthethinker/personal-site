- title: Electronic device for communicating in augmented reality and method thereof
  abstract: An augmented reality (AR) device supporting an AR is provided. The AR device includes a display, a communication circuit, at least one processor operatively connected to the display and the communication circuit, and a memory operatively connected to the at least one processor. The memory stores instructions that, when executed, cause the at least one processor to establish a connection with a user device storing a contact application and a message application, through the communication circuit, detect that the message application is executed, and display a first graphic user interface (GUI) and at least one avatar, which is disposed at a location adjacent to the first GUI and corresponds to at least one contact associated with the contact application or the message application, through the display in the AR.

- title: Efficient encoding of depth data across devices
  abstract: One embodiment provides a method comprising determining a spatial relationship between an augmented reality (AR) device and a camera-equipped device. The AR device is worn by a user. The camera-equipped device is positioned within proximity of the user. The method comprises determining, based on the spatial relationship, minimum and maximum boundaries of a user volume encompassing a head and one or more extremities of the user. The minimum and maximum boundaries represent a reduced depth range that is narrower than a full depth range of a camera frustum of the camera-equipped device. The method further comprises encoding, based on the minimum and maximum boundaries, a depth image frame captured via the camera-equipped device, and transmitting the encoded depth image frame over a remote network connection. A reconstructed 3D image based in part on the encoded depth image frame is rendered by a different AR device.
  description: In an AR-HMD and depth-capture-enabled phone system, decrease the depth data that needs to be encoded by using dynamic min-max culling.

- title: Automatic representation toggling based on depth camera field of view
  abstract: One embodiment provides a method comprising determining a spatial relationship between an augmented reality (AR) device and a camera-equipped device. The AR device is worn by a user. The camera-equipped device is positioned within proximity of the user. The method further comprises determining a position of the user relative to a field of view of the camera-equipped device, and providing a representation of the user for display. The representation automatically switches between a real image of the user and a virtual avatar of the user based on the position of the user.

- title: System and method for augmented reality interaction
  abstract: A method, an electronic device, and computer readable medium is provided. The method includes identifying a plurality of virtual objects for output to a display of the electronic device, including a priority level for each of the plurality of virtual objects. The method also includes comparing the priority level of an object of the plurality of virtual objects to the priority level associated with another object of the plurality of virtual objects to determine whether to modify an appearance of either object. In response to determining to modify the appearance of either object, the method further includes modifying the appearance of either. The method additionally includes rendering the plurality of virtual objects on the display of the electronic device.

- title: Mobile device with a foldable display and method of providing user interfaces on the foldable display
  abstract: A system and method for controlling presentation on a foldable display of an electronic device is provided. A foldable electronic device comprises a foldable housing including a hinge structure, a first housing structure and a second housing structure foldable and unfoldable with respect to the first housing structure about the hinge structure. The electronic device includes a processor and a memory to store instructions that cause the processor to receive a first user input to select an application program; detect a change from a folded state to an unfolded state; determine whether the selected application program has user interface size restrictions; and in the unfolded state, display a user interface of the selected application on at least a portion of the foldable display, based in part on the screen size restriction.

- title: System and method for head mounted device input
  abstract: According to one implementation, a head mounted display (HMD) device comprises a motion detector, a display, and a processor coupled to the motion detector and the display. A memory is also coupled to the processor, wherein the memory stores executable instructions that cause the processor to define an available range for a motion and output a graphic user interface for the available range on the display. An input based upon a motion of the HMD device detected by the inertial motion unit, within the available range is received. One of the HMD device or an external device may then be controlled in response to the input.
  description: Utilizing head or body movement as a discrete or continuous input. Useful in limited contexts for non-primary input.

- title: System and method for transition boundaries and distance responsive interfaces in augmented and virtual reality
  abstract: A head mounted display (HMD) device is provided. The HMD has a display panel, a depth or distance sensor to measure distances between the HMD and a real object. The HMD device sets a close transition boundary distance (CTBD) between the HMD and a close transition boundary (CTB). A far transition boundary distance (FTBD) is set between the HMD and a far transition boundary (FTB). The CTBD is less than the FTBD. As a real object that has associated near and far virtual content moves nearer to the HMD device and crosses the CTB, the virtual content transitions to near virtual content for viewing on the HMD. As the real object moves away from the HMD and crosses the FTB, the virtual content transitions to the far virtual content for viewing on the HMD.
  description: Increased legibility and contextual controls based on user distance from UI. Additional system to prevent rapid toggling when user stands on boundary line.

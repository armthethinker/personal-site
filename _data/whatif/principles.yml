  caption: We create the most robust solutions when we merge insights from disparate locations. Matt and I actively recruited diverse speakers and participants. We believe there can be fruitful conversations between engineers, high school students, mechanics, authors, PhDs, designers, entrepreneurs, and everyone else.

- header: Democratizing question-asking
  caption: In expert–novice environments, novices shy away from asking questions. At our events or in our book, we flatten this hierarchy to encourage questions from everyone. By recognizing and respecting the abilities of both experts and novices, the two can have a more balanced and engaging conversation. Experts can see things from a new perspective. Novices can learn something new.

- header: Everything can be questioned
  caption: We allow <i>anyone</i> to ask a question about <i>anything</i>. All social institutions and technologies are built by people who asked their own questions. We encouraged participants to question it all — as long as they were diligent in their question asking methodology. No one is interested in vapid questions, but our audiences love insightful explorations of intriguing questions.
